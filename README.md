## My Experience with Go & Approach
This assignment was a rewarding challenge and a great opportunity to dive into Go, a language I hadn’t worked closely with before. Coming from a strong Java background, I was able to leverage my experience with best practices while quickly adapting to Go’s idioms. I followed Go’s naming conventions and structured the project according to its standard practices。
## Final Thoughts
This project not only served as a technical challenge but also as an opportunity to grow and learn a new programming language. I appreciate the chance to demonstrate my problem-solving skills and technical expertise, and I look forward to the possibility of contributing further in a professional capacity.

Thank you for taking the time to review my work!
